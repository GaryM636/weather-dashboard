# Weather Dashboard

## Description

The Weather Dashboard is a web application that allows users to check the current weather and 5-day forecast for multiple cities. It utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data, and the user can search for cities to view weather information. The app also stores search history using localStorage, allowing users to easily access the weather details for previously searched cities.

## Usage

1. **Search for a City:**
   - Enter the city name in the provided input field.
   - Click the "Search" button or press Enter to retrieve weather information.

2. **View Current Weather:**
   - Once a city is searched, the current weather details, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and an icon representing weather conditions, will be displayed.

3. **View 5-Day Forecast:**
   - Below the current weather, the app provides a 5-day forecast with details such as date, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather icon representation for each day.

4. **Search History:**
   - The app keeps track of the search history, and users can click on previously searched cities to view their current and 5-day forecast again.
